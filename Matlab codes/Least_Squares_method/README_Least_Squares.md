This code is destined to obtain a polynomial approximation for any dataset inserted.

The user only needs to insert the dataset in the form of vectors for the x and y axis (it doesn't matter if it is a column vector or a row vector) and insert
the desired degree of the polinomial as the value of n.

If the user desires, the code can be adapted to generate various curves in a wide range of polynomial degrees, for comparison values, and it can even be used to compare
a polynomial approximation with an exponential approximation, that can be easily found by using the built-in expression "fit" from MATLAB. In fact, this code is destined
to ilustrate the application of the mathematical description for the method, more than to be useful in any manner.

Hope you all enjoy.
