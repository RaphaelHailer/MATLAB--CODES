MATLAB--CODES
Programs in MATLAB for Scientific Purposes

This repository is destined to store all of my MATLAB coding experience for my own and for university tasks, such as projects for numerical calculus and for numerical methods applied to engineering.

Many of the codes are for specific applications, so they are ment to highlight the skills acquired during my journey of scientific coding. But there are also the codes for general purpose, such as the code to generate curves with scattered data using the least squares method.

I hope that any reader enjoy my repository and, if possible, contribute along to enhance the codes!
