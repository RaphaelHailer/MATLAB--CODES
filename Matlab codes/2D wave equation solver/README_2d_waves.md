Matlab code for solving the two dimensional wave equation with constant values at the quadrangular domain (Dirichlet boundary conditions for x and y) 
and initial derivative in time equals given, for all x and y inside the domain. 

In addition, the profile u(x,y,0) must be informed bu the user in the first plot zone of the code. The code also saves a video animation in .avi format
for the plot as time evolves, in order to see what is happening during all iterations.

It is remarkable to notice that there is a convergence condition:
- alphax and alphay must be less or equal to sqrt(2)/2.
