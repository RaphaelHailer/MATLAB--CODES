This folder is destined to deposit all my files regarding my final project of the Numerical Methods Applied To Engineering course, at my home univeristy (Unicamp).

The problem presented is to solve the two dimensional heat equation using the FINITE ELEMENTS METHOD for conduction of heat on a plate with different thermal conductivities and different geometries,
enumered as 1, 2 and 3. The program and the project's description is all in brazilian portuguese and it explains the problem in it's details.

Hope all of you enjoy these programs, as they work for different geometries as well. All you need to do is to change the material coeficcients matrix, along with the
"incidencia" matrix, destined to store the coordinates and material of each element (lines of matrix indicate the number of the element).
